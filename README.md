octomore is an efficient, functional data retrieval and transformation library for node.js. It is named after the heavily peated [scotch whisky](https://www.bruichladdich.com/octomore) (which has absolutely nothing to do with this library). 

## Installation
```
npm install --save octomore
```

## Concepts
